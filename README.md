# MSFS Bergen Helipads
Helipads for Bergen, Norway in MSFS2024 and MSFS2020

- ENBG - Grønneviksøren Heliport
- ENBI - Sandviken Helipad (ENSA in MSFS2020 because of duplicate ICAO)
- ENBX - Haukeland Hospital Helipad

## Installation
- If you already have one or more of these heliports installed, delete them.
- Drop one or all included airports in the pack, into your MSFS Community folder
- Enjoy!

## Recommended addons
[Bergen Features](https://flightsim.to/file/8938/bergen-features) to have Haukeland Hospital helipad be correctly placed.

## Credits
- Jannik04 for taking reference photos of Grønnviksøren and beta testing!

## Known issues
MSFS2024
- The Sandviken Helipad is named "Bjorli Airfield" in MSFS2024. I've not managed to override this weird name issue, but the helipad works and is placed correctly.
- You need to select parking explicitly when trying to spawn on Haukeland (ENBX), otherwise your helicopter will spawn under the helipad.

MSFS2020
- There are terrainspikes when approaching the helipad. These disappear when you get closer.

# Development

## Folder structure

\* This project is unfortunately missing the materials for models, as I lost them. If you regain them somehow, I'd really appreciate a pull request!
